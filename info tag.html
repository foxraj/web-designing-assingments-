Bruce Lee (Chinese: 李小龍; born Lee Jun-fan, 李振藩; November 27, 1940 – July 20, 1973) was a Hong Kong
 and American martial artist and actor. He was the founder of Jeet Kune Do, a hybrid martial arts
 philosophy drawing from different combat disciplines that is often credited with paving the way for
 modern mixed martial arts (MMA). Lee is considered by critics, media, and other martial artists to be
the most influential martial artist of all time and a pop culture icon of the 20th century, who bridged
the gap between East and West. He is credited with promoting Hong Kong action cinema and helping to change
the way Chinese people were presented in American films.
