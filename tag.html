Bruce Lee (Chinese: 李小龍; born Lee Jun-fan, 李振藩; November 27, 1940 – July 20, 1973) was a Hong Kong
 and American martial artist and actor. He was the founder of Jeet Kune Do, a hybrid martial arts
 philosophy drawing from different combat disciplines that is often credited with paving the way for
 modern mixed martial arts (MMA). Lee is considered by critics, media, and other martial artists to be
the most influential martial artist of all time and a pop culture icon of the 20th century, who bridged
the gap between East and West. He is credited with promoting Hong Kong action cinema and helping to change
the way Chinese people were presented in American films.

<li>Born in San Francisco and raised in British Hong Kong, Lee was introduced to the Hong Kong</li>
<li>film industry as a child actor by his father. However, these were not martial arts films.</li>
<li>His early martial arts experience included Wing Chun (trained under Yip Man), tai chi, boxing</li>
<li>(winning a Hong Kong boxing tournament), and apparently frequent street fighting</li>
<li>(neighbourhood and rooftop fights). In 1959, Lee, having U.S. citizenship due to his birth</li>
<li>was able to move to Seattle.</li>
<li>In 1961, he enrolled in the University of Washington.</li>
<li>It was during this time in the United States that he began considering making money by</li> 
<li>teaching martial arts, even though he aspired to have a career in acting.</li>
<li>He opened his first martial arts school, operated out of home in Seattle.</li>
<li>After later adding a second school in Oakland, California, he once drew significant attention</li>
<li>at the 1964 Long Beach International Karate Championships of California by making demonstrations and speaking</li>
<li>He subsequently moved to Los Angeles to teach,</li>
<li>where his students included Chuck Norris, Sharon Tate, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.</li>
<li>In the 1970s, his Hong Kong and Hollywood-produced films elevated the Hong Kong martial arts films to</li>
<li>a new level of popularity and acclaim, sparking a surge of Western interest in Chinese martial arts.</li>
<li>The direction and tone of his films dramatically influenced and changed martial arts and martial</li>
<li>arts films worldwide.</li>
